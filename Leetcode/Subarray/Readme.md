## Subarray Problems

_A subarray is a contiguous part of array, i.e., Subarray is an array that is inside another array._
**In general, for an array of size n, there are n*(n+1)/2 non-empty subarrays.**

_A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by removing zero or more elements, without changing the order of the remaining elements._

**More generally, we can say that for a sequence of size n, we can have (2n â€“ 1) non-empty sub-sequences in total.**
