# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.In dynamic programming, problems are solved by breaking them down into smaller ones to solve the larger ones, while recursion is when a function is called and executed by itself.

- Top-Down Approach (Memoization)
- Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)

- ## Common Problems of DP
  
- Longest Common Subsequence (LCS): Finds the longest common subsequence between two strings.
- Shortest Path in a Graph: Finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
- Knapsack Problem: Determines the maximum value of items that can be placed in a knapsack with a given capacity.
- Matrix Chain Multiplication: Optimizes the order of matrix multiplication to minimize the number of operations.
- Fibonacci Sequence: Calculates the nth Fibonacci number.
